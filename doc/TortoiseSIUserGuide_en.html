<h1 id="section1">Overview of TortoiseSI</h1>
<p>TortoiseSI is a free, open-source Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; shell extension client for PTC Integrity that exposes PTC Integrity views, source commands, and version-controlled member actions on Windows files and folders through Windows Explorer. PTC Integrity is a cross-platform, enterprise-class software configuration management and versioning solution.</p>

<h2 id="section1_1">What You Can Do With TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI offers you a light-weight open-source interface to perform various Integrity Sandbox and member operations, access Integrity data views, and commit changes to the repository. TortoiseSI displays <a href="#section6_2">icon overlays</a> in Windows Explorer to indicate working file status in the file system.</p>

<h2 id="section1_2">Who is this Guide For?</h2>
<p>This guide is intended for anyone interested in accessing Integrity views and performing Integrity operations directly from the Windows Explorer interface.</p>
<p>Since TortoiseSI is a Windows shell extension, this documentation assumes that the user is familiar with and proficient at using Microsoft Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Developers who are interested in getting involved with the TortoiseSI project can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/wiki">GitHub TortoiseSI wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section1_3">TortoiseSI Context Menu</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI commands are available from the Windows Explorer context menu, and they are visible when you right-click on a file, folder, or subfolder.</p>
<p>The TortoiseSI context menu commands update dynamically based on selection context. You can also see the TortoiseSI menu as part of the Windows Explorer <b>File</b> menu.</p>
<p><img src="images/TortoiseSIContextMenu.png" alt="TortoiseSI Context Menu" /></p>

<h1 id="section2">Installing and Configuring TortoiseSI</h1>
<h2 id="section2_1">TortoiseSI Installation Prerequisites &ndash; Alpha Release</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A PTC Integrity 10.7 Client is required. Once TortoiseSI is installed, the Integrity Client starts automatically when Windows starts up.</li>
  <li>Microsoft Windows 7 is supported.</li>
  <li>TortoiseSI only supports files located on fixed local drives. Optical drives, network drives, and mass storage devices are not supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you encounter any problems during or after installing TortoiseSI, please refer to the <a href="#section2_6">Troubleshooting Tips</a> section first before <a href="#section7">contacting us</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2_2">Installing TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI comes with a straightforward installer Setup Wizard. Double-click on the installer file and follow the instructions. The installer takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>To download a TortoiseSI build:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In a browser, navigate to the <a href="http://www.TortoiseSI.org">TortoiseSI GitHub project page</a>.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Downloads</b> section, click to download the TortoiseSI install for your operating system platform.</li>
  <li>Run the downloaded TortoiseSI MSI installer and proceed through the Setup Wizard.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section2_3">Installing Language Packs</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI may be available in additional languages as an MSI language pack installer file. If a specific language translation is not yet available, consider submitting your own translation to the project via the <a href="http://www.TortoiseSI.org">TortoiseSI GitHub project page</a>.</p>
<p>TortoiseSI uses the appropriate language pack for the configured Windows Display Language when installed and available. For example, when the Windows Display Language is set to German and the German TortoiseSI language pack is installed on the system, the TortoiseSI interface displays in German.</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you do not have a corresponding TortoiseSI language pack installed for the configured Windows Display Language, TortoiseSI defaults to English.</li>
  <li>Non-translated strings always default to English strings in the TortoiseSI interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>To download and install TortoiseSI language packs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that you install the English TortoiseSI application first before attempting to install an available language pack.</li>
  <li>Download the language pack you want to install from the <a href="http://www.TortoiseSI.org">TortoiseSI GitHub project page</a>.</li>
  <li>Run the language pack installer and navigate through the Setup Wizard.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the Windows Display Language is configured for the TortoiseSI language pack you have installed. TortoiseSI should display in the correct language.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section2_4">Updating TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>You can install a newer build version of TortoiseSI directly on top of your existing installation.<br />
You do not need to uninstall your current TortoiseSI application first.</p>

<h2 id="section2_5">Verifying a Successful Installation</h2>
<p>Once TortoiseSI is installed on the system, you can verify that the install was successful by creating a Sandbox in Integrity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using Windows Explorer, navigate to a folder on the file system.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the folder and select the <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Create Sandbox</b> option.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/TortoiseSIRightClickOption.png" alt="TortoiseSI Right-Click Option" /></li>
  <li>When prompted, connect to an Integrity Server with valid credentials.</li>
  <li>When prompted, create a Sandbox using Integrity Client Create Sandbox Wizard. For details on creating Sandboxes in Integrity, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em>, <em>Integrity Help Center</em>, or <em>Integrity CLI man pages.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section2_6">Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
<h3 id="section2_6_1">Connecting to Integrity Server</h3>
<p>TortoiseSI automatically connects to the Integrity Server. The specific server is based on your Integrity Client preferences. </p>
<p>If you are not prompted to connect to an Integrity Server, verify that the Integrity Client is running, and that the client application can communicate with an Integrity Server.</p>
<p>If TortoiseSI loses its connection to the Integrity Server, it will work silently in offline mode. To force a connection to the Integrity Server, perform an operation that requires a server connection, such as viewing a Sandbox via the Integrity Sandbox view.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The user needs to be notified if TortoiseSI cannot find an Integrity Client installed on the system. This feature will be implemented in a future release. For more information, see open issue <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/issues/41">41</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/issues">GitHub TortoiseSI issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_2">No Icon Overlays</h3>
<p>If you are unable to see the TortoiseSI <a href="#section6_2">icon overlays</a> on files and folders in Windows Explorer, restart Windows Explorer or reboot the machine.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_3">Unsupported File System Locations</h3>
<p>TortoiseSI only supports files located on fixed local drives.</p>
<p>File locations that are not supported by TortoiseSI include optical drives, network drives, and mass storage devices. If a file location is not supported, the <a href="#section1_3">TortoiseSI context menu</a> is not available.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_4">Multiple Integrity Clients Installed</h3>
<p>If you have more than one Integrity Client installed on the machine, TortoiseSI uses the first Integrity Client on the PATH environment variable. For more information on debugging non-standard configurations, such as running multiple Integrity Clients, see the <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/wiki">GitHub TortoiseSI wiki</a>.</p>

<h1 id="section3">Managing Integrity Sandboxes with TortoiseSI</h1>
<h2 id="section3_1">Sandboxes Overview</h2>
<p>Using TortoiseSI, you can perform various Integrity Sandbox operations. An Integrity Sandbox is a local pointer to an Integrity project residing on the Integrity Server. A Sandbox on the file system functions as a mirror image of a version-controlled Integrity SCM (software configuration management) project. Each Integrity Sandbox is actually a collection of pointers to files in the master project. Integrity Sandboxes allow you to work locally in your own workspace, without interfering with the work of others.</p>

<h2 id="section3_2">TortoiseSI Sandbox Operations</h2>
<p>The following Integrity Sandbox operations are available using TortoiseSI. The equivalent Integrity command is listed for each supported TortoiseSI Sandbox operation.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Where applicable, TortoiseSI commands launch additional Integrity commands, dialogs, and workflows. Integrity operations follow configured Integrity Client preferences.</p>
<p>For information on Integrity Sandbox operations, Integrity commands, or Integrity Client preferences, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em>, <em>Integrity Help Center</em>, or <em>Integrity CLI man pages</em>.</p>

<h1 id="section4">Working with Files as Integrity Members</h1>
<h2 id="section4_1">Members Overview</h2>
<p>With TortoiseSI you can perform various Integrity member operations to files in a Sandbox for Integrity version-controlled projects. Member operations are applied to the version-controlled project in Integrity after the related change package is submitted.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Where applicable, TortoiseSI commands launch additional Integrity commands, dialogs, and workflows. Integrity operations follow configured Integrity Client preferences.</p>

<h2 id="section4_2">TortoiseSI Member Operations</h2>
<p>The following member operations are available using TortoiseSI. The equivalent Integrity command is listed for each supported TortoiseSI member operation.</p>

<h1 id="section5">Committing Changes to the Repository </h1>
<p>You can use the Integrity Client&rsquo;s Working File Changes view  to compare the file system against the version-controlled Integrity project.  The view lists all of the files, folders, and subfolders that have been added, updated, or deleted.</p>
<p>To commit changes to the repository, right-click on an Integrity Sandbox and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; View Working File Changes</b> to access the Integrity Client Working File Changes View.</p>
<p>Use this view to move selected files to Integrity change packages. Submit selected Integrity change packages to commit those changes to the repository. For more information on Integrity change packages and the Working File Changes view, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em>.</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the Integrity Client Working File Changes view to commit changes to the repository is a temporary mechanism that will be superceded in a future TortoiseSI release by a native TortoiseSI Submit Change Package dialog accessible by selecting  <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Submit CP</b>. For more information, see open issues <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/issues/30">30</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/issues/107">107</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/issues">GitHub TortoiseSI issue tracker</a>.</li>
  <li>HotFix 1030228 has been released for Integrity Client 10.7 regarding the Working File Changes view. The HotFix reduces the number of user prompts are displayed when moving multiple entries to change packages. For more information, contact PTC - Integrity Support through the <a href="https://support.ptc.com/appserver/cs/portal/">Integrity Support Center</a>.</li>

<h2 id="section6_4">Excluding Files</h2>
<p>You can use TortoiseSI to exclude uncontrolled files in a Sandbox from appearing in selections when adding members to a version-controlled Integrity project. For example, you may want to always avoid adding specific DLL files or all EXE files without having to remember to exclude them manually. Excluded files are added to the Integrity Client Non-Member Files exclusion filter preference.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To exclude a specific file by filename, right-click on a single file and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Add to exclude filter</b> <b>&gt; [the file you want to exclude]</b>.</li>
  <li>To exclude files by file pattern, right-click on a single file and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Add to exclude filter</b> <b>&gt; *.extension.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note: </b>You cannot use TortoiseSI to remove excluded entries from the exclude filter. You must use the Integrity Client Preferences Configuration dialog to remove <b>Non-Member Files Filter</b> entries from the exclude filter<b>.</b> For more information, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em>, <em>Integrity Help Center</em>, or <em>Integrity CLI man pages</em>.</p>
