##How to View the Documentation

A link to view the latest official release of the TortoiseSI documentation can be found on the [TortoiseSI project page] (http://www.tortoisesi.org).

The current unofficial documentation is found in a single HTML file above. A two character language code at the end of the filename indicates what language the documentation is in.  For example, the **_en** in **TortoiseSIUserGuide_en.html** indicates the English language.

If you wish to view current unofficial documentation you can do one of the following:

1. Use [http://rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com) or [http://htmlpreview.github.io](http://htmlpreview.github.io).  Simply copy and paste the URL of the html file into one of those sites.  For example, to view the English documentation paste the following URL: **https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/blob/master/doc/TortoiseSIUserGuide_en.html**
2. If you are familiar with Git, you can clone the TortoiseSI repository and open the HTML page in a web browser from your local drive. For information on how to setup a local reporsitory, see the **Git Local Repository Setup** section in the [Introduction to the Git Workflow](https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/wiki/Introduction-to-the-Git-Workflow#git-local-repository-setup) instructions of the TortoiseSI wiki.
3. Save each file locally by clicking on the file, clicking the **Raw** button, and then right-clicking and selecting **Save As...**. In order to get images and formatting to show up, be sure to create local **images** and **css** directories and save each file in those directories as well.


##Contributing to the Documentation

If you wish to translate the TortoiseSI documentation, copy the English HTML file (**TortoiseSIUserGuide_en.html**) and rename it by changing the last two characters to the  ISO-639-1 language code of the translation. Look up your language code here: [http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langcodes.html](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langcodes.html).
